# Eq platform 

I bought a telescope to see stars, but I have encountered a problem : When I was observing the stars in my telescope, they were moving with the rotation of the earth. So I studied and modeled a project called 'Equatorial Platform'. This one, through its movement, and with the inclination equal to my latitude, allowed to follow the rotation of the earth.
