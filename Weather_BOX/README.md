## Wheather Box

The weather box was originally created to be housed in a greenhouse claiming to be autonomous. Indeed, the idea was to collect as much weather data as possible (such as luminosity, temperature, humidity, and the number of millimeters of rain that finally fell).

Therefore, this project is still in progress, and will want to evolve to become connected (connected to the network) and send this data to an API (also created later).
As a result, we can also create a Dashboard, facilitate graphs of weather data, anywhere, anytime.
